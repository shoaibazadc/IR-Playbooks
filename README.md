# IR-Playbook-Library - Playbooks, Procedures & Compliance

This playbook library covers the full incident response lifecycle: detection criteria, triage logic, containment procedures, escalation paths and post-incident reporting, all built from simulated attacks in an isolated homelab SOC environment.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1 - Infrastructure
Deployed Wazuh, TheHive and Zeek in an Ubuntu Server VM (`soc-core`). Configured an isolated VirtualBox NAT network (`soc-net`, `10.0.5.0/24`) with port-forwarding rules to access the services on the host.

### Phase 2 - Endpoint Configuration
Deployed victim VMs as Wazuh agents alongside an attacker VM. Installed Sysmon with the SwiftOnSecurity config on the Windows machine and configured Wazuh to ingest `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational` event channel logs.

### Phase 3 - Attack Simulation
Ran each scenario on the victim VMs before writing the corresponding playbook. Tools and techniques used per scenario:

```
Phishing       -> Malicious .hta / macro-enabled Word doc  -> Sysmon Event ID 1, 3
Malware        -> Metasploit meterpreter reverse shell     -> Sysmon Event ID 1, 3
Ransomware     -> RanSim / Python file encryptor           -> Wazuh FIM mass modification
Lateral Move   -> Metasploit PSExec / pass-the-hash        -> Event ID 4624, 7045
Brute Force    -> Hydra credential spray against RDP/SMB   -> Event ID 4625, 4740
Exfiltration   -> netcat large file transfer               -> Sysmon Event ID 3
```

### Phase 4 - Detection and Triage
Triaged the incident for each scenario: created cases, added observables and performed IOC enrichment. Also Documented Wazuh rule IDs, Sysmon events, Zeek log entries and Wazuh dashboard queries used during the investigation.

### Phase 5 - Playbook Creation
Wrote each playbook based on what happened in the lab. Each playbook contains:

- **Detection criteria** - Wazuh rule IDs and Sysmon event IDs that trigger the playbook
- **Triage questions** - first five questions to answer within five minutes of alert
- **Decision tree** - Mermaid diagram with branching containment logic
- **Escalation matrix** - L1 -> L2 -> L3 -> CISO triggers and handover requirements
- **ISO 27001 lifecycle phases** - Identification, Protection, Detection, Response and Recovery
- **Recovery validation checklist** - sign-off criteria before returning to production
- **UK GDPR / ICO compliance** - 72-hour notification obligations flagged per scenario
- **Known detection gaps** - what the stack misses and what would close the gap
- **Automation scripts** - shell and PowerShell for containment, evidence collection, threat hunting
- **IOC template** - pre-formatted for TheHive ingestion
- **Real-world reference** - UK-relevant incident tied to each scenario

Post-incident reports completed per scenario using the standard template.

## Detection Gaps

This stack's known detection limitations are as follows:

- **Raw TCP exfiltration** - Wazuh cannot detect large files being transferred out over raw TCP connections
- **Encrypted C2 over HTTPS** - command and control traffic sent over HTTPS looks identical to normal web browsing, SSL inspection is needed to rectify the situation
- **Phishing email delivery** - Wazuh has no visibility into email traffic, a mail gateway integration is needed to rectify the situation

---

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Incident Response** - end-to-end case lifecycle across six MITRE ATT&CK-mapped scenarios
- **Threat Intelligence** - IOC enrichment via VirusTotal and AbuseIPDB
- **Adversary Emulation** - attack simulation using Metasploit, msfvenom and netcat
- **UK Regulatory Compliance** - ICO notification obligations and ISO 27001 lifecycle phases integrated into each playbook
- **Scripting & Automation** - PowerShell and Bash for host isolation, evidence collection and threat hunting

---

## Setup
